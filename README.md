Created for the OSCP, this dumps all SMBShares on the target. Usage is simple...

Make sure you chmod +x sdas.sh

run it as root with with **sudo ./sdas.sh target [username] [password]**

This will create a directory called smb_dump and within that it will create separate folders with the share name and everything dumped from it within.
